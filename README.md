This simple project uses an Arduino Uno to control 3 LEDs with 3 buttons. Press a button to light its LED.
Connect buttons to pins 2, 3, and 4 with 10 kΩ resistors to GND and 5V, and LEDs to pins 5, 6, and 7 with 220-330 Ω resistors to GND.
Upload the code from sketch.ino via USB, and test by pressing each button to see the LEDs light up.
If it doesn’t work, check all wires and resistor connections.
